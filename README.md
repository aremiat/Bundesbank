# Bundesbank
bundesbank loader to automatically retrieve all the data from bundesbank.
We use a csv file with all the keys and iterate on it to get API data.

Then we create our meta that will be used to get the name, description, frequencies and units of the series.

And we formate our data, with timestamp/values/country/symbolkey
